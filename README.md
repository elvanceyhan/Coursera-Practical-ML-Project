 Coursera Practical Machine Learning Project
 Overview
This project is part of the Coursera Practical Machine Learning course. The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which participants performed barbell exercises using accelerometer data collected from sensors on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell. The outcome variable, classe, indicates the type of activity performed. 
The analysis involves cleaning the data, building a predictive model using machine learning techniques, and evaluating the model's performance. Predictions are also made for a set of 20 test cases.
